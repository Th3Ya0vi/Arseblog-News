# Arseblog News iOS Application

Written by Adam Lum [http://adamlum.com](http://adamlum.com)

I wrote this small application that allowed a user to save the latest thirty [Arseblog News](http://news.arseblog.com) entries. There was already an [Arseblog](http://www.arseblog.com) iOS application available in the App Store at the time, and this app functioned similarly but only for the main [Arseblog](http://www.arseblog.com) website.

Upon emailing the website's owner he advised me that their soon to be released version of the [Arseblog](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arseblog/id369606006?mt=8) app was going to include [Arseblog News](http://news.arseblog.com), asking me not to submit my app. I am a huge fan of this website and in no way want to draw any attention from their products (not that my app would anyway, theirs is awesome) I happily obliged.

I am simply posting the project here as a iOS5 code example for myself that parses an RSS feed and uses Core Data for storing the feed's items.
